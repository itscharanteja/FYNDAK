## üîç Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### Environment Variables Not Working

**Problem**: App shows connection errors
**Solution**:

- Ensure `.env.local` file is in the root directory
- Verify variable names start with `VITE_`
- Restart development server after changes

#### Database Connection Errors

**Problem**: "Failed to fetch" errors
**Solution**:

- Check Supabase project URL and API key
- Verify your Supabase project is active
- Check browser network tab for specific error details

#### Migration Fails

**Problem**: SQL errors when running migration
**Solution**:

- Ensure you have a fresh Supabase project
- Copy the entire migration file content
- Run in SQL Editor, not CLI
- Check for any existing tables with same names

#### Images Not Uploading

**Problem**: Image upload fails with 400 error
**Solution**:

- Verify storage bucket exists
- Check RLS policies are applied
- Ensure file size is reasonable (< 10MB)
- Check browser console for specific errors

#### Real-time Updates Not Working

**Problem**: Bids don't update in real-time
**Solution**:

- Check browser network tab for WebSocket connections
- Verify Supabase real-time is enabled
- Check RLS policies allow reading bid data
- Try refreshing the page

### Performance Issues

#### Slow Loading

- Optimize images (already implemented)
- Enable caching on your hosting provider
- Consider implementing lazy loading for auction lists

#### High Database Usage

- Review and optimize queries
- Implement pagination for large auction lists
- Add database indexes for frequently queried fields
